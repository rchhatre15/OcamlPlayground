# OCaml Playground 🐪

This repository contains three OCaml projects demonstrating various aspects of programming language theory, formal languages, and data structures. Each project showcases different theoretical concepts and practical implementations in functional programming. These projects were completed as part of the CMSC330 (Organization of Programming Languages) course at the University of Maryland.
